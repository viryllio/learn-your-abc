Alphabet Learning App
This project is an interactive web application that teaches children the letters of the alphabet, objects that begin with each letter, and their sounds. After learning the letters both visually and audibly, users can practice tracing them on a drawing canvas and receive immediate feedback on their accuracy.

The app is built using the p5.js library.

Development Process and AI Usage
Artificial intelligence (AI) was an active partner throughout this project, from initial concept to final product:

Prototyping (Processing): The project’s first concept was quickly prototyped in the more familiar Processing (Java) environment. The core game logic was established at this stage.

Code Conversion (p5.js): To make the prototype universally runnable on the web, it was converted into p5.js (JavaScript) format using Gemini AI models.

Debugging: Technical issues encountered during development, such as file path errors (Invalid URL) and macOS‐specific runtime problems, were analyzed and resolved with AI assistance.
